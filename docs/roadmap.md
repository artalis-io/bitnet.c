## Performance Analysis (M1 Max, bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T)

### Current: ~52.5 tok/s (8 P-cores)

The workload is **DRAM bandwidth-bound**. Each token reads ~0.83 GB from memory:

| Component | Data Read | % of Total |
|---|---|---|
| 30x layer I2_S weights (Q/K/V/O + gate/up/down) | 497 MB | 60% |
| Logits (INT8 embedding x 128K vocab) | 328 MB | 40% |
| KV cache (pos-dependent) | ~18 MB | <2% |

M1 Max CPU aggregate DRAM bandwidth: ~55 GB/s (CPU-only; the 400 GB/s spec is GPU-inclusive).
At 52.5 tok/s x 0.83 GB = **~43 GB/s sustained** — 79% of max bandwidth.

### Optimization history

| Change | tok/s | Delta |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline (naive C) | ~15.5 | — |
| SDOT int8 accumulation + batch matvec | ~33 | +113% |
| Arithmetic ternary decode + RoPE precompute | ~38 | +15% |
| Pthread thread pool (replace OMP) | ~41 | +8% |
| Arena allocator + FP16 native logits + prefetch | ~46 | +12% |
| INT8 output embeddings + SDOT logits | ~52.5 | +14% |

### Multi-model benchmarks (M1 Max, 8 P-cores, PGO)

| Model | Format | Size | tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T | I2_S | 1.1 GB | 52.5 |
| Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct | Q4_0 | 1.7 GB | 30.0 |
| Llama3-8B-1.58 | TQ1_0 | 3.4 GB | 14.5 |

### What would move the needle

Only **reducing data volume** helps at this point:

1. **Speculative decoding** — use a smaller draft model to reduce per-token cost.
2. **KV cache quantization to INT8** — further reduces attention data at long positions.
3. **Weight clustering / pruning** — reduce I2_S weight data below 497 MB.

## Phase 9: Concurrent Sessions & Prompt Cache — Done

- [x] Prompt cache integrated in chat mode CLI

## Phase 10: SIMD Backend Parity — Done

- [x] AVX2 flash GQA (online softmax attention)
- [x] WASM flash GQA + scalar flash GQA
- [x] WASM I8 SDOT logits + `bn_quant_f16_rows_to_i8` for WASM

- [x] 9 WGSL forward-pass shaders (rmsnorm, rope, gqa_scores, softmax, gqa_combine, silu_gate, relu2_gate, residual_add, bias_add)
- [x] `bn_model_upload_weights` / `bn_model_release_gpu` for GPU buffer management
- [x] Norm weight + bias + tied embedding GPU upload
- [x] Persistent scratch buffers + batched command encoding

## Future Work

### Transformer Architecture Redesign

The next major maintainability item is to split `src/transformer.c` into explicit planning and execution layers while preserving CPU correctness and Metal/WebGPU behavior. The goal is not a new math path first; it is to make model-family, quant-format, and backend decisions visible and testable before adding more SoTA model and quant coverage.

Target architecture:

```
GGUF/model load -> model anatomy + tensor roles
quant layer     -> format operations
backend layout  -> uploaded buffers and optional stacked/fused layouts
planner         -> layer/block execution plan
executor        -> CPU / Metal / WebGPU / CUDA
```

- [x] **Step 1: map and freeze behavior** — catalog every architecture branch, quant special case, and backend fast path in `transformer.c`; add lightweight route tests for QKV, FFN, MoE, SSM, KV cache, flash attention, and fallback behavior. See [transformer-behavior-map.md](transformer-behavior-map.md).
- [x] **Step 2: start the kernel capability layer** — replace direct backend capability bit checks with named internal predicates (`bn_transformer_gpu_can_*`) and cover them in `test_transformer`.
- [x] **Step 3: extract layer-shape planning** — introduce internal helpers for `is_attn`, `attn_idx`, `ssm_idx`, `q_dim`, `q_gated`, `q_wide`, per-layer `head_size`, `kv_dim`, `n_kv_heads`, `kv_mul`, and KV mode. These helpers should be synthetic-testable without loading a GGUF.
- [x] **Step 4: define per-block plan structs** — add small internal plan structs for attention, FFN, SSM, MoE, logits, and backend placement. Start with `BnAttentionPlan` carrying layer kind, KV mode, Q/K/V shape, norm/bias flags, and placement.
- [x] **Step 5: split CPU planning from CPU execution** — make `forward_single_layer` consume layer/block plans while keeping CPU math straightforward and reference-quality. Do not optimize or fuse CPU behavior during this step.
- [x] **Step 6: split GPU op emission by block** — move GPU construction out of `forward_gpu` into internal emitters such as `emit_gpu_attention_ops`, `emit_gpu_ffn_ops`, `emit_gpu_ssm_ops`, `emit_gpu_moe_ops`, and `emit_gpu_logits_ops`.
- [x] **Step 7: make fusion rules declarative** — represent QKV split, gate/up fusion, RoPE QK fusion, residual+norm, flash attention, Q4_K split, Q8 split, and Q5_K split as rule checks with explicit required tensor roles, quant format, shape compatibility, activation, and backend cap.
- [x] **Step 8: move backend buffer layout out of model loading** — keep `model.c` responsible for model anatomy and tensor roles; move QKV stacks, gate/up stacks, SSM stacks, fused bias buffers, and backend-specific upload choices into a backend layout layer.
- [x] **Step 9: extract architecture-specific model rules** — move Qwen/Gemma/DeepSeek/Nemotron-style shape, activation, norm, MRoPE, SSM, and shared-expert rules out of the main transformer loop into model-architecture helpers.
- [x] **Step 10: make backend placement explicit** — choose CPU, Metal, WebGPU, future CUDA, or CPU fallback per planned op/block. Fallback must be deterministic and visible in tests/debug output.
- [x] **Step 11: enforce parity gates** — require `make clean && make bitnet`, `make test`, coherence tests for touched GPU backends, and llama.cpp CPU/Metal benchmark comparisons before declaring the redesign complete.

Success criteria: adding a new quant should primarily touch `gguf`, `quant`, backend kernels, and capability registration; adding a backend should primarily implement `BnGPUBackend` and advertised caps; adding a model family should primarily touch model metadata and architecture helpers. `transformer.c` should stop accumulating backend/model/quant cross-product branches except for genuinely new execution primitives.

### Architecture Cohesion Follow-up

The transformer redesign introduced explicit plan structs and capability checks, but the ownership boundaries are still not fully orthogonal. `BnModel`, `BnLayerWeights`, `BnQWeight`, backend upload state, quant-format metadata, and GPU shader graph details still leak into each other. The next architecture phase should make model anatomy, quant formats, backend layouts, and execution backends independently extensible.

Target ownership model:

```
GGUF parser       -> raw tensor metadata and bytes
model anatomy     -> architecture, tensor roles, layer/block semantics
model weights     -> immutable CPU-visible weights and CPU-side transforms
quant registry    -> format sizing, layout, CPU kernels, backend capabilities
backend model     -> uploaded buffers, packed/fused layouts, backend-owned weights
backend session   -> activation buffers, KV buffers, per-request backend state
op planner        -> backend-neutral layer/block execution plan
backend lowerer   -> CPU / Metal / WebGPU / CUDA / AVX512 concrete execution
```

- [x] **Step 12: split loaded weights from backend-resident weights** — introduce `BnBackendModel` and `BnBackendSession` so GPU handles, stacked QKV buffers, gate/up stacks, SSM stacks, norm uploads, fused bias buffers, and future CUDA state no longer live inside `BnModel`, `BnLayerWeights`, or `BnQWeight`. `BnModel` should remain shared, immutable, and backend-independent after load.
- [x] **Step 13: make quant formats table-driven** — add a `BnQuantFormatOps` registry that owns data sizing, block geometry, dequant support, CPU matvec/matmul hooks, repack support, native-layout support, split-matvec support, and backend capability registration. Adding a new quant should not require editing unrelated switch forests across `model`, `quant`, `transformer`, and GPU upload code.
- [x] **Step 14: replace concrete GPU shader IDs with backend-neutral op kinds** — define an intermediate operation IR (`MATVEC`, `RMSNORM`, `ROPE`, `ATTENTION`, `FFN`, `FUSED_GATE_UP_ACT`, `LOGITS`, etc.) and let each backend lower it to Metal/WebGPU/CUDA-specific kernels. Keep shader IDs and buffer indices private to backend implementations.
- [x] **Step 15: promote backend layout into a real module** — move inline layout/upload helpers out of `include/backend_layout.h` into `src/backend_layout.c`. This module should choose native vs repacked layouts, stacked tensors, fused-bias buffers, QKV/gate-up/SSM packing, and record deterministic fallback reasons for debug output and tests.
- [x] **Step 16: make model architecture rules pluggable** — replace one-off config flags such as `arch_gemma4` with a `BnModelArchOps` registry for architecture-specific config loading, tensor-role mapping, layer classification, activation/norm rules, MRoPE rules, SSM rules, MoE/shared-expert rules, and future Qwen/Gemma/DeepSeek/Nemotron variants.
- [x] **Step 17: shrink `transformer.c` into orchestration only** — split the remaining implementation into focused modules such as `transformer_plan.c`, `transformer_cpu.c`, `transformer_gpu_emit.c`, `transformer_kv.c`, `transformer_attention.c`, `transformer_ffn.c`, `transformer_ssm.c`, and `transformer_logits.c`. The top-level transformer loop should select plans, execute blocks, and handle deterministic fallback, not encode backend/model/quant cross-product logic.
- [x] **Step 18: add architecture boundary tests** — add synthetic tests that prove model load does not allocate backend state, backend upload does not mutate model anatomy, quant registry entries advertise consistent capabilities, and CPU/GPU/CUDA/AVX512 placement decisions are visible before execution. These tests should not require model files.

Success criteria: model-family additions primarily register architecture rules and tensor-role mappings; quant additions primarily register `BnQuantFormatOps` and kernels; backend additions primarily implement layout lowering and execution; `BnModel` remains backend-neutral; fallback decisions are explainable in logs/tests; and `transformer.c` no longer needs direct knowledge of individual quant formats or backend shader IDs.

Current audit for Steps 12-18:

| Step | Current evidence | Remaining gap |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | `BnBackendModel` and `BnBackendSession` own GPU handles, qweight buffers, backend graph state, stacked QKV/gate-up/SSM buffers, norms, biases, and tied embeddings. `BnQWeight`, `BnLayerWeights`, and `BnWeights` no longer expose GPU handles. | CUDA-specific backend state is not implemented yet. |
| 13 | `BnQuantFormatOps` registry centralizes format names, block geometry, sizing, embedded-scale behavior, support status, CPU matvec/batch/matmul capability, generic CPU matvec/matmul hook entrypoints, GPU split capability, backend-neutral GPU split op-code selection, fused gate-up SiLU backend capability, CPU pre-Q8K activation reuse capability, CPU repack capability, GPU native-layout capability, and GPU repack-layout capability. Transformer planning records registry-selected split/native layout decisions instead of per-format Q8/Q5/Q4 flags, and CPU/MoE/GPU-emission paths query quant capabilities instead of hard-coding Q4_0/Q8_0/Q4_K/Q5_K split-shader choices or Q4_K/Q6_K pre-Q8K reuse. | Per-format CPU hook specialization and some backend lowering choices are still partly in dispatch/backend switch logic. |
| 14 | `BnGPUOpKind` gives each emitted GPU op a semantic kind and `BnGPUOpCode` adds a backend-neutral concrete-op layer. `BnGPUOp` no longer exposes `shader`, public headers no longer export `BN_GPU_SHADER_*` IDs or shader mapping helpers, quant registry and transformer planning expose split op codes only, and `src/transformer/gpu_emit.c` is op-code-only. Public graph references now use `BN_GPU_VALUE_*`; current Metal/WebGPU shader IDs, backend activation slot aliases, and op-code-to-shader lowering live in backend-private `src/gpu_shader.h` plus backend `execute` implementations. Tests verify op-code-to-kind behavior and the backend matrix rejects shader IDs in GPU emission. | `src/transformer/gpu_emit.c` still emits the backend command array directly. A future IR pass should model graph values and multi-output ops explicitly before backend command lowering. |
| 15 | `include/backend_layout.h` is declarations-only and `src/backend_layout.c` owns stacked/fused upload decisions plus deterministic fallback reasons covered by tests. | Native/repacked layout selection is still narrow and mostly GPU-upload focused. |
| 16 | `BnModelArchOps` registry covers architecture matching, explicit Qwen/BitNet/Gemma4 family entries, prefixes, activation, Gemma4 shape rules, SSM-layer classification, MoE config helpers, architecture flags, and tensor-role name/scale mapping for attention, SSM, dense FFN, MoE expert, and shared-expert roles. The old `arch_gemma4` config field is removed. | MRoPE/local-attention rules, DeepSeek/Nemotron rules, tokenizer-family rules, and backend placement constraints need fuller registry entries. |
| 17 | Planning moved to `src/transformer/plan.c`; QKV/logits/RMSNorm/attention/SSM/dense-FFN/MoE GPU emission moved to `src/transformer/gpu_emit.c`; GPU-resident forward graph orchestration moved to `src/transformer/gpu.c`; TurboQuant, FP16, and FP32 KV row/write helpers moved to `src/transformer/kv.c`; CPU logits orchestration moved to `src/transformer/logits.c`; batch prefill moved to `src/transformer/prefill.c`; CPU layer execution, attention execution, SSM block execution, dense-FFN block execution, FFN activation, residual add, RoPE application, and GQA backend dispatch moved to `src/transformer/cpu.c`; `transformer.c` now handles token bounds, embedding/RoPE setup, CPU-vs-GPU top-level routing, and logits timing. It is currently 144 lines, down from 2,699 before the split. | `transformer.c` is now near orchestration-only, but `src/transformer/gpu_emit.c` still builds backend command arrays directly instead of producing a higher-level graph-value IR first. |
| 18 | Synthetic tests cover backend model/session ownership, upload-not-mutating CPU weights, quant registry metadata, model-load-without-backend-state, model architecture registry behavior, CPU execution helper boundaries, CPU ISA placement including AVX-512, and Metal/WebGPU/CUDA placement visibility. | There is no CUDA implementation or real CUDA/AVX-512 benchmark matrix beyond advertised placement visibility. |

Latest local gate: `make test`, `make clean` followed by `make bitnet`, `make BN_ENABLE_METAL=1 test_coherence`, `./test_coherence models/qwen2.5-3b-instruct-q4_0.gguf --metal`, `make BN_ENABLE_WEBGPU=1 test_gpu_wgpu`, `make bench_llama_compare`, and `./test/backend_matrix.sh` pass after the shader/buffer contract cleanup. `make BN_ENABLE_WEBGPU=1 test_gpu_wgpu` compiles the WebGPU backend but skips runtime GPU checks on this machine because wgpu-native reports no suitable adapter. The llama.cpp comparison gate runs three trials and reports median plus mean. On `qwen2.5-3b-instruct-q4_0.gguf` with 32 tokens and 8 threads, the latest run measured median bitnet.c at 39.30 tok/s versus median llama.cpp at 17.59 tok/s (median ratio 2.2347; mean ratio 2.1997). This short 32-token benchmark remains noisy and should be treated as a gate/check, not a durable performance claim. `./test_coherence models/qwen2.5-3b-instruct-q4_0.gguf --metal` passes all phases with exact five-token greedy decode match, CPU SIMD/scalar checks, and Metal standalone matvec versus CPU scalar. The previous real-model prefill check reported matching top token with max logit drift 0.676631 versus sequential forward.

### Backend Expansion Plan

The backend roadmap should follow the architecture cleanup rather than racing ahead of it. CUDA, AVX-512, Metal, WebGPU, WASM SIMD, and scalar CPU should share quant metadata, model-family rules, execution planning, and fallback reporting. Backend-specific code should own only layout lowering, kernel selection, memory residency, and execution.

- [ ] **CUDA backend** — add a `BnGPUBackend` implementation backed by CUDA streams, device buffers, graph capture where useful, and kernels for matvec, batched matvec, RMSNorm, RoPE, attention, FFN, logits, MoE routing, SSM, and KV-cache operations.
- [ ] **CUDA quant kernels** — implement CUDA kernels for the active GGUF formats first (`Q4_0`, `Q8_0`, `Q4_K`, `Q5_K`, `Q6_K`, `Q8_K`, `BF16`, `F16`, `F32`), then add IQ and ternary formats once the registry can advertise per-backend capability precisely.
- [ ] **CUDA memory policy** — make backend sessions own activation buffers, KV buffers, temporary reductions, graph scratch, and stream-local state so multiple sessions can share one immutable backend model safely.
- [ ] **AVX-512 backend** — add AVX-512 VNNI/BF16 kernels behind compile-time and runtime detection, with scalar/AVX2 fallback. Target `Q4_0`, `Q8_0`, `Q4_K`, `Q5_K`, `Q6_K`, `Q8_K`, `BF16`, and logits first.
- [ ] **AVX-512 dispatch hygiene** — keep AVX-512 as a quant/backend implementation detail registered through `BnQuantFormatOps`, not as new architecture branches inside `transformer.c`.
- [ ] **Backend parity matrix** — maintain a test/benchmark matrix for scalar, NEON, AVX2, AVX-512, WASM SIMD, Metal, WebGPU, and CUDA showing which op kinds and quant formats are native, repacked, split, fused, or CPU fallback.
- [ ] **llama.cpp comparison gate** — for every new backend milestone, compare prompt processing and token generation against equivalent llama.cpp runs on the same model, quant, thread count, context length, and GPU/CPU placement.

### Quantization Coverage Plan

Quant support should be added through the quant registry and backend capability table. A format is not considered fully supported until sizing, dequant, CPU matvec, CPU batch path where relevant, backend upload/layout, native or repacked backend kernels, tests, and llama.cpp comparison coverage are all accounted for.

- [ ] **Complete remaining legacy GGUF formats** — add or finish `Q5_0`, `Q5_1`, and any still-missing legacy variants with scalar, NEON/AVX2/WASM, AVX-512 where applicable, and backend capability registration.
- [ ] **Finish IQ-family parity** — verify and fill gaps for `IQ1_S`, `IQ1_M`, `IQ2_XXS`, `IQ2_XS`, `IQ2_S`, `IQ3_XXS`, `IQ3_S`, `IQ4_NL`, and `IQ4_XS` across CPU SIMD, WASM SIMD, and GPU fallback/native paths.
- [ ] **Add modern low-bit GPU-friendly formats** — evaluate `MXFP4`/`NVFP4`-style block floating formats, `FP8` (`E4M3`/`E5M2`) where GGUF/tooling support exists, and other SoTA OSS deployment formats before committing to kernels.
- [ ] **Native-layout kernels before repack proliferation** — prefer zero-copy native GGUF layouts when they are competitive, especially for `Q4_0`, `Q8_0`, and k-quants, and use repacking only when it gives a measured win.
- [ ] **Quant capability tests** — add synthetic tests that validate block size, data size, scale layout, native/repacked support, split support, backend support, and fallback reasons for every registered quant.
- [ ] **Quant benchmark fixtures** — keep a small benchmark suite that runs the same prompt through bitnet.c and llama.cpp for representative dense, MoE, and hybrid models across common quants.

### Model Family Support Plan

Model-family support should be data-driven through model architecture ops, tensor-role mapping, and planner-visible capabilities. The goal is dedicated support for current OSS model families without turning `model.c` or `transformer.c` into family-specific switchboards.

- [ ] **Qwen 3.5 / Qwen 3.6** — register architecture rules for config loading, tokenizer assumptions, GQA layout, RoPE/MRoPE behavior, activation, norm placement, MoE/shared-expert variants, and backend placement constraints.
- [ ] **Gemma 4** — finish pluggable Gemma-family rules for shape derivation, shared attention value/key behavior, local/global attention, altup-style blocks if present, and family-specific tensor naming.
- [ ] **DeepSeek v4 Flash** — add architecture rules for MLA/MoE-style routing if present in GGUF exports, shared experts, routed experts, activation/norm behavior, and memory-aware expert loading.
- [ ] **Nemotron 3 Super** — add architecture rules for tensor naming, block layout, activation/norm choices, attention variants, and quant/backend restrictions once public GGUF conventions are stable.
- [ ] **Model-family fixtures** — add synthetic config tests for every architecture rule and at least one real GGUF smoke/coherence test per supported family when model files are available.
- [ ] **Unsupported-feature reporting** — fail early with explicit messages when a model requires an op kind, tensor role, quant format, or backend capability that bitnet.c does not yet implement.

### Cross-Product Support Matrix

Do not add model, quant, or backend support as isolated one-offs. Each milestone should update a visible matrix that says which model families, quant formats, and backends are native, repacked, partially supported, or CPU fallback.

- [ ] **Model families x backends** — track Qwen 3.5, Qwen 3.6, Gemma 4, DeepSeek v4 Flash, Nemotron 3 Super, existing Qwen2/Qwen3, Llama-style dense models, BitNet ternary models, and MoE/hybrid families across scalar, NEON, AVX2, AVX-512, WASM SIMD, Metal, WebGPU, and CUDA.
- [ ] **Quant formats x backends** — track F32, F16, BF16, Q4_0, Q4_1, Q5_0, Q5_1, Q8_0, Q2_K, Q3_K, Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q8_K, IQ-family formats, TQ1_0/TQ2_0/I2_S, and evaluated FP8/MXFP4/NVFP4-style formats across every backend.
- [ ] **Model families x quants** — record the recommended and tested quants for each family, including dense, MoE, SSM, MLA, local/global attention, and ternary/BitNet-style variants.
- [ ] **Fallback reasons** — every unsupported matrix cell should point to a concrete missing capability: tensor role, op kind, quant kernel, backend memory policy, architecture rule, tokenizer behavior, or validation fixture.
- [ ] **Benchmark parity rows** — for representative cells, keep bitnet.c vs llama.cpp prompt-processing and generation numbers with the same model, quant, thread count, context length, batch size, and GPU placement.

### Transformer Module Split Plan

`transformer.c` should become orchestration, not the place where model families, quant formats, backend details, and fallback rules accumulate. This is the next highest cleanup item before broad CUDA/AVX-512/model-family expansion.

- [ ] **Move planning into `src/transformer/plan.c`** — layer kind, tensor roles, shape derivation, KV mode, backend placement, and fallback decisions should be built once and tested synthetically.
- [ ] **Move CPU execution into `src/transformer/cpu.c`** — keep reference CPU math readable and backend-independent, consuming only plans, model weights, session state, and quant dispatch APIs.
- [ ] **Move backend op emission into `src/transformer/gpu_emit.c`** — lower backend-neutral op kinds into the `BnGPUBackend` command interface without exposing shader IDs to planner code.
- [ ] **Move attention/KV helpers into focused modules** — isolate RoPE, flash attention, GQA, sliding-window KV, FP16 KV, TurboQuant KV, and MRoPE behavior behind narrow internal APIs.
- [ ] **Move FFN/MoE/SSM/logits helpers into focused modules** — isolate dense FFN, gated activation, MoE routing/expert loading, SSM blocks, and logits paths so model families compose features instead of branching in the main loop.
- [ ] **Delete cross-product branches as modules land** — after each split, remove the equivalent direct checks from `transformer.c` and add route tests proving the same placement and fallback decisions.

### GPU Optimization
- [ ] Improve GPU forward-pass shader precision (match CPU output beyond first token)
- [ ] FP16 KV cache on GPU
- [ ] Sub-norms, Q/K norms, gated-Q support in GPU forward path
- [ ] MoE expert dispatch on GPU

### Extended Model Support
- [ ] LoRA adapter loading
- [ ] Dedicated Qwen 3.5 / Qwen 3.6 support through `BnModelArchOps`
- [ ] Dedicated Gemma 4 support through `BnModelArchOps`
- [ ] Dedicated DeepSeek v4 Flash support through `BnModelArchOps`
- [ ] Dedicated Nemotron 3 Super support through `BnModelArchOps`

### Developer Experience
- [x] Interactive mode (--chat REPL with sliding window)
- [ ] Token probability output mode (for debugging/research)
- [ ] JSON output mode (structured generation metadata)
- [ ] Model info dump command (`--info` to print config without inference)

### GPU Performance (Metal/WebGPU)

Current: 290 ops, 289 barriers, ~22.7ms/token on M1 Max (Qwen 2.5 3B Q4_0). llama.cpp: ~9ms.

**Key finding**: Barriers cost zero (22.7ms with 0 barriers vs 22.8ms with 289). The bottleneck is **Q4_0 matvec kernel execution** — the DQ4 dequantization + float4 dot product inner loop. Reducing ops/barriers further has no impact. The path to parity requires a fundamentally faster matvec kernel.

- [x] Eliminate COPY ops: direct-to-destination QKV writes via shader offsets (-108 ops, -108 barriers)
- [x] Batched QKV matvec: single-dispatch split shader for Q4_0 (-72 ops)
- [x] PSO caching: skip redundant setComputePipelineState calls
- [x] Fused RoPE Q+K: single dispatch for Q and K rotation (-36 ops)
- [x] Fused gate+up+SiLU: stacked weight buffer, single Q4_0 kernel (-72 ops, -36 barriers)
- [x] Fix logits tiling: dispatch (4748,1,1) not (65535,1,1) for vocab=151936
- [ ] **Q4_0 native-format kernel** (THE bottleneck): our repacked format splits scales and nibbles into separate memory regions (~2.8MB apart for gate weights). llama.cpp reads ORIGINAL GGUF format (18 bytes/block, contiguous) with a pre-scaling trick: mask uint16 with 0x000F/0x00F0/0x0F00/0xF000, pre-divide input by 1/16/256/4096 to absorb bit positions. Zero shift instructions. Sequential weight reads. Enables zero-copy from mmap. Implementation started but has correctness issues in the pre-scaling math — needs careful nibble layout verification against GGUF Q4_0 spec (qs[j] = elem[j] | (elem[j+16] << 4)).
- [ ] MATVEC_SPLIT + fused_gateup_silu for native Q4_0 format (currently disabled, use repacked)
- [ ] Half-precision intermediates where precision allows

### SIMD Backends
- [ ] AVX-512 VNNI — native `vpdpbusd`, 512-bit vectors (Ice Lake+, Zen 4+)

### Platform Expansion
- [ ] Windows support (VirtualAlloc instead of mmap)
- [ ] iOS/Android builds (static library)
- [ ] Python bindings (ctypes or cffi wrapper)
- [ ] Node.js native addon

## Non-Goals

- Full GGUF compatibility (only supported types listed above)
- Training or fine-tuning
- Multi-GPU / distributed inference
- Replacing llama.cpp for general LLM inference
- HTTP server (that's Hull's job)
